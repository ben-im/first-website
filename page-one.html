  <h2>
    History
  </h2>
  <div class="paragraphs">
    Anime is almost always based on a previously written manga. Manga is a japanese form of comic or drawn story. Modern
    anime first began in 1956 and has made many advancements with animation studios utilizing many tools such as CGI,
    hand-drawing, and computer-assisted drawing. Although traditionally voiced over in Japanese, most anime can be
    viewed in a variety of languages. Anime comes in many forms such as shorts, 20-30 minute episodes, and full length
    movies. It is so diverse, you most likely can find one for almost any concept you can think of.

    Genres
  </h2>
  <div class="paragraphs">
    There are more genres of anime than you can think of. Whether it be a story about a young protagonist's growth as
    they face new enemies, a story about a protagonist's everyday life and daily activities, a story based on horror and
    thrill, or whatever else you can think of, it probably exists. There is something out there for everyone in the
    world of anime. Many people think that anime is not for them, but anime is just a form of media and any concept you
    can think of probably exists. To give an idea of how obscure these shows and films can get, there is a very popular
    anime about a boy who goes to the most prestigious school for cooking and must battle other students to claim to top
    spot.
